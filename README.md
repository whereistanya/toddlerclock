toddlerclock is a small binary that runs continuously. It displays the time and it can be configured to display events that are supposed to be happening during that time, e.g., going to sleep, getting up, and reading. Its goal is to tell my four year old when she can come wake me up. It... was not that successful? Oh well.

It runs on a raspberry pi with a piTFT or DSI display. It may well work with other displays, but those are the two I've tested it on. If you run it on a regular workstation, it'll display a small window.

You need pygame installed, e.g., pip install pygame.
